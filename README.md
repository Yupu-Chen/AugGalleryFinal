GalleryEverywhere is an AR application that allows users to curate their own exhibitions and share them through a built-in community and on social media. We were inspired by the reading on ignorant museums to replicate the experience of knowledge creation and the Van Abbemuseum's DIY Archive, using AR as a means of creating accessibility and allowing everyone to digitally handle and interact with works they would never be able to in real life.

It is simple and straightforward, both to ensure accessibility and to avoid as far as possible, any implicit meaning-making on our part, externally imposing certain views or understandings of the art on users. Instead, users are able to choose any piece from our selection, view some basic factual information about it, and if they please, arrange it digitally on the space around them using AR. Once users have arranged all the art they wish, then they are able to create an "exhibition", with their own title, description, and images accompanying it. After creating an exhibition, it is shared with the rest of the world, and others users can view it, while sharing their own.

One of the key challenges faced (and still yet to be resolved) with this project is how to best "share" the exhibitions users create. Our current route is one of practicality--it is difficult to image a world where we could fully capture then reproduce the spatial data of every user's exhibition. Yet, this implementation is sorely lacking in a true sense of spatiality, which is critical to how these exhibitions are arranged. A potential path forward may be to ask users to build a 360-degree static image of their exhibition, using spliced photographs akin to how some applications stitch together panoramas. The technology for building this app was reasonably straightforward, and if it were to be built out into a full app, managing the server design, and how the community interacts with one another, especially in sharing their experiences, would be the utmost priority.
